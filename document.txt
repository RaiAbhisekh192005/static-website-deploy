Navigate to the directory where the .pem file is saved.
Connect to the EC2 instance using SSH.
Install Required Packages:

Update the package lists.
Install Nginx web server.
Transfer Website Files to the EC2 Instance:

On your local machine, use SCP to transfer the website files to the EC2 instance.
Deploy the Website:

Connect to the EC2 instance via SSH (if not already connected).
Navigate to the project directory.
Run the deployment script.
